A car travels 25 miles at 25 miles per hour (mi/h), 25 miles at 50 mph, and 25
miles at 75 mph. Write a program to find the arithmetic mean of the three velocities and
the harmonic mean of the three velocities. Which is correct?

Code:
dist <- c(25,25,25)
speed <- c(25,50,75)
my_data <- rep(speed,dist)
# To find Arithmatic mean
arithmetic_mean_speed <- mean(my_data)
arithmetic_mean_speed
# call library
library(psych)
# to find harmonic mean
harmonic_mean_speed <- harmonic.mean(my_data)
harmonic_mean_speed
print("Since speed have fraction unit measure therefore ,Harmonic mean is correct mean")



Output:
arithmetic_mean_speed
[1] 50
harmonic_mean_speed
[1] 40.90909
[1] "Since speed have fraction unit measure therefore ,Harmonic mean is correct mean"
