Suppose the number of games in which major league baseball players play during their
careers is normally distributed with mean equal to 1500 games and standard deviation
equal to 350 games. Use R to solve the following problems. (a) What percentage play in
fewer than 750 games? (b) What percentage play in more than 2000 games? (c) Find the
90th percentile for the number of games played during a career.



Code:
print("What percentage play in fewer than 750 games")
pa<-pnorm(750, mean = 1500, sd = 350)
Percenta <- pa*100
print(Percenta)
print("What percentage play in more than 2000 games")
pb<-pnorm(2000, mean = 1500, sd = 350, lower.tail = FALSE)
Percentb <- pb*100
print(Percentb)
print("the 90th percentile for the number of games played during a career")
p05<-round(qnorm(0.05,mean = 1500, sd = 350),0)
p95<-round(qnorm(0.95,mean = 1500, sd = 350),0)
cat("Range for 90 Percentile is : ",p05,"-",p95)



Output:
[1] "What percentage play in fewer than 750 games"
[1] 1.606229
[1] "What percentage play in more than 2000 games"
[1] 7.656373
[1] "the 90th percentile for the number of games played during a career"
Range for 90 Percentile is : 924 - 2076
